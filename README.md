## Automated Scoring System

The portal uses an automated bot (`scripts/recalculate-scores.mjs`) to assign scores for each day's submission. The maximum score for standard days is **30 points**, but **Day 1 and Day 2** have a max of **25 points** (Prompting is disabled).

Here is exactly how the daily marks are calculated:

- **Submission (`+10 pts`)**: Automatically given if you created your folder and pushed code.
- **Documentation (`+0 to +5 pts`)**: An automated heuristic checks your main deliverable file (e.g., `profile.md` for Day 1, or `README.md` for other days). If any `.md` file in your folder has markdown headers (`#`) and more than 80 characters of meaningful content, you get 5 points. If your markdown files are missing, mostly empty, or just copy-pasted templates, you get 0 points.
- **Quality (`+5 pts`)**: Given by default (until manual review).
- **Reflection (`+5 pts`)**: Given by default (until manual review).
- **Prompting (`+5 pts`)**: 0 points on Day 1 & Day 2 (disabled). Otherwise, given by default (until manual review).

> [!TIP]
> If you received `20 points` instead of `25 points`, your Markdown file (`profile.md` or `README.md`) failed the documentation check! Make sure you are writing actual content, using markdown headers, and avoiding blank templates.
